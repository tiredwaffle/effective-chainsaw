Everything you need to try to understand how from two table we get the queries for evolution of formulas. 
While I was writing this code, only I and god knew how this works. Now only god knows.
I left some comments though. I wish you all of the best luck with debug. 



Aliases (so you and me talk on the same language)

1. First level formulas
    UE_THROUGHPUT_DL = [NUE_THROUGHPUT_DL_KBIT / DUE_THROUGHPUT_DL]
2. First level counters
    NUE_THROUGHPUT_DL_KBIT, DUE_THROUGHPUT_DL
3. Second level formulas
    NUE_THROUGHPUT_UL_KBIT = (8*((M8012C91+M8012C93+M8012C95+M8012C97+...
4. Second level counters
    M8012C91, M8012C93, M8012C95...



The order in which I recommend get acquainted with the project:

1. The README file.                               <----  you are here now  ----
2. The main_notebook Jupyter notebook. I left some comments on general logic there (I left many hours of my young life there as well).
3. helpers_demo Jupyter notebook. Just to understand what every function is supposed to do, and locate why and where the problems started.
4. Library Helpers. All main functions lives there. With comments. On almost every line.
5. Alexandr Semenov. He knows general aproach.
6. God I suppose? If it didn't become clear by now, I don't know how to help you.
