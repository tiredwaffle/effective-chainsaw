A project to track the development of formulas in a large-scale production database.
The database on which the project was built processes millions of new records every day. The statistics formed from these data are calculated according to the formulas which under the influence of various factors periodically change. In processing such statistics, it is sometimes important to obtain data for a certain period with formulas that were relevant at that time.
The resulting script allows you to create statistics with formulas that were used at any given time.
